                    Additional Understanding:
                        All classes and properties belong to the 'uni' prefix, except 'type', which belongs to the 'rdf' prefix.
                        Properties follow the format: Domain -> Property -> Range.
                        Object properties relate two classes, while data properties link a class to a value.
                        Never place a triple inside FILTER; use FILTER correctly.
                        To specify the type of something, use the 'rdf:type' property.
